Despite this improvement in unemployment, the overwhelming majority of the unemployed—70.8 percent—had by that time been unemployed for 5 to 14 weeks, as much of the initial wave of unemployment remained without work and moved into longer duration categories.\nEven though total unemployment continued to decline in June and July, the composition of unemployment still shifted to longer durations. By July, the largest share of the unemployed, at 39.6 percent, were unemployed for 15 to 26 weeks. In September, 6 months after the emergency declaration, the share unemployed for 27 weeks or longer was growing rapidly.

As repairs on the dam were completed in the fall of 2018, construction employment fell. Then, the Camp Fire broke out in November and a few months later, construction employment in Butte County began to increase again.\nWhile the fires currently raging in California continue to have a large impact on its citizens, infrastructure, buildings, and environment, one silver lining is that labor markets have recovered quickly from large, destructive fires in the past.

The new measure summarizes how widespread employment increases or decreases are across all states or metropolitan areas.\nTo create diffusion index for all states and the District of Columbia, we start by assigning the states and DC a value of 0, 50, or 100 depending on whether employment decreased, stayed the same, or increased during the period we are looking at. Next, we average the 51 values. That average is the state diffusion index. Similarly the metropolitan area diffusion index is the average value for 388 metropolitan areas.\nAn index greater than 50 means more states or metropolitan areas had increasing employment over the period. An index below 50 means more states or metropolitan areas had decreasing employment. At the extremes, an index of 0 means employment fell in all states or metropolitan areas; an index of 100 means employment rose in all of them.\nThe 1-month diffusion index in July 2020 was 94.1 for all states and 82.5 for all metropolitan areas. These are similar to the indexes for May and June, but sharply different from the March and April indexes, which were at or near zero.",

The national average wage for this occupation was $106,550 in May 2019.\nThese days, moms are often teachers. The national average wage for preschool teachers in May 2019 was $34,650 per year. The average wage for secondary school teachers was $65,930, similar to the wages for elementary school teachers ($63,930) and middle school teachers ($63,550). And if moms have to spend extra time explaining that algebra equation to their teenagers, they’re also tutors. Tutors and teachers and instructors earned on average $48,700 per year.\nMoms sometimes are precision instrument and equipment repairers, making sure everyone's electronic devices are working properly for online schooling, gaming, and video streaming. The average wage for this occupation was $59,940.\nWhen organizing arts and crafts activities, moms are recreational workers! The national average wage for this occupation was $29,330. Moms sometimes are carpenters (average wage $52,850), repairing a cabinet or stairway or helping kids build something with wood. Moms are also painters (average wage $44,640), decorating kids’ rooms in their favorite colors.\nSince many hair salons are also closed, moms might cut and style their children’s hair; hairdressers and hairstylists earned on average $31,530. Cleaning the house after those activities, disinfecting everything little fingers touch—maids and housekeeping cleaners earned on average $26,810.\nMoms cook! The national average wage for chefs and head cooks was $56,310. However, moms don’t always have the time to prepare a gourmet meal. Fast food cooks earned on average $23,530. Kids don’t always get the meal from the stove to their plates on their own, so moms also serve food. Waiters and waitresses earned on average $26,800. Keeping the kitchen clean, washing the dishes, and cleaning the appliances—there’s an occupation for that, too! Dishwashers earned on average $24,410 per year. And at the end of the day, moms sometimes pour themselves a glass of wine. Bartenders earned on average $28,000.\nMoms do many very important jobs at home every day.

Average wages in the industry were $1,538 per week in third quarter 2019. That compares with an average weekly wage of $1,093 for all workers in the United States.\nWashington state had the highest concentration of employment in electronic shopping and mail-order houses. In September 2019, the industry’s employment share in Washington was more than 6 times higher than the national share of employment in the industry. Utah, New Hampshire, Arizona, and Wisconsin also were among the states with employment shares above the national average.\nLocation quotients are the ratio of an industry’s employment share in an area to its national share. For example, an industry with 6 percent of state employment and 2 percent of national employment would have a location quotient in that state of 6/2 = 3. A location quotient greater than 1 means the industry has a higher share of area employment than the national average.",
