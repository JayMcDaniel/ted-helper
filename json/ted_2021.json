The steeper decline among Asians likely reflects the fact that self-employed Asians disproportionately work in the other services industry. That industry includes nail salons, drycleaning and laundry services, and electronic and precision equipment repair. The other services industry lost a large share of its employment in the early months of the pandemic, when mandatory business closures, stay-at-home orders, and fear of the illness kept many people from engaging in both labor market and consumer activity.\nIn the year after the onset of the pandemic, the decline in employment for government workers—a category that includes public school teachers, state university employees, workers at public hospitals, and police officers—was also somewhat steeper for Asians than for the population overall (−4.1 percent, compared with −2.7 percent).\nEmployment for Asians and the population overall declined by a similar proportion among private wage and salary workers in the year after the onset of the pandemic.

The marginally attached are neither working nor looking for work but want and are available for a job and have looked for work sometime in the past 12 months. People who work part time for economic reasons are those that would have preferred full-time employment, but were working part time because their hours had been cut or because they were unable to find a full-time job.\nThe U-6 rate was 10.4 percent in April 2021.
